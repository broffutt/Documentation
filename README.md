# Documentation

Documentation created by me for everything I've interacted with,
to the extent it's occured to me to do so.

The file structure will probably be refactored a number of times as
the scope of its contents grows. This will be meant to be a "one-stop-shop"
for all documentation I've created with Markdown.
