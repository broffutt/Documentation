# Documentation

Documentation created by me for everything I've interacted with,
to the extent it's occured to me to do so.

Also, I will reference outside resources as frequently as I can.
The contents of this repo are majorly things I have personally
implemented or found interesting enough to document for retention
purposes. Otherwise, the outside resources are referenced for
additional reading, if so desired.

The file structure will probably be refactored a number of times
as the scope of its contents grows. This will be meant to be a
"one-stop-shop" for all documentation I've created with Markdown.

I very much appreciate RFCs, so I'll adopt these concepts
(link to be added once more clearly articulated).
