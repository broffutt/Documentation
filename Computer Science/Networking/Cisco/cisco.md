# Cisco Documentation Philosophy

> Editor's Note:
>
> I despise Cisco's available documentation, so I'm rewriting it
> entirely for each device that I have.  Primarily, my issue is that a majority
> of the documentation is written in the style of a guide and I am unable to
> locate an exhaustive list of each available command.  I tried to write the
> documentation in the style of [docopt](http://docopt.org), but couldn't
> get all the options to be coherent.  As I am a Microsoft fanboy, I've
> decided to go with the style of the Windows Commands as written in the
> Windows Server Docs, primarily referencing `ping`.
